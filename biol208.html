        <h2>Approaches to studying genetics</h2>
        <h3>Genetic approach</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Studies physical property of an organism first.</li>
            <li>Studies inheritable trait of a given organism, e.g. how plants
            bend towards light and sleeping patterns in mice.<ul>
                <li>You can intentionally create mutations using chemicals
                (EMS), radiation (UV), or transposons.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Forward genetics</h4>
        <p>Observe a random change in phenotype. Find the gene involved.</p>
        <p>Phenotype =&gt; Genotype</p>
        <h4>Reverse genetics</h4>
        <p>Mutate a gene. Observe the change in phenotype.</p>
        <p>Genotype =&gt; Phenotype</p>
        <h3>Biochemical approach</h3>
        <p>Study proteins, enzyme activity, etc. to find out how and where the
        proteins are expressed.</p>
        <p>Biochemists make assays of to measure how active an enzyme is.</p>
        <h3>Bioinformatic approach</h3>
        <p>Bioinformatics allows biologists to</p>
        <ul>
            <li>look up databases to see if anyone else had already done a
            similar experiment,</li>
            <li>find results from these similar experiments,</li>
            <li>write algorithms to simulate biological environments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In general, bioinformatics saves money by reducing the amount of lab
        work needed.</p>
        <h2>Model organisms</h2>
        <h3>Benefits</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>cheap</li>
            <li>short lifecycle - easy to observe entire generations /
            reproduction</li>
            <li>transformable - easy to mutate its genes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Organism-specific benefits</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><em>S. Cerevisiae </em>(yeast) has the benefit of being a
            rapidly-reproducing eukaryote that is cheap to maintain and &quot;similar
            to humans&quot; in terms of genome.</li>
            <li><em>D. Melanogaster </em>(fruit fly) is among the cheapest
            organisms for studying behaviour and development.</li>
            <li><em>M. Musculus </em>(house mouse) is really, really close to
            the human genome, and is relatively fast to clone.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Disadvantages of using model organisms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Findings on model organisms might not be reflected on humans,
            because humans are more complex.</li>
        </ul>
