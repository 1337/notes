<h2>Unit 1 - Three beginnings of Psychology</h2>

<h3>&#160;Basic Philosophy of Science&#160;</h3>

<p>Skepticism -&gt; "Our ideas can often be wrong" -&gt;
  encourages testing</p>

<p>Demonstrate how our ideas are wrong. If you can't prove
  you wrong, then you are probably right for now... (and accept
  thus)</p>

<p>What is accepted is often what is popular (the experiments
  that are done)</p>

<p>Influenced by political and social forces</p>

<h3>&#160;Ways of Doing Research&#160;</h3>

<p>Discovery needs explanation to make sense</p>

<p>
  <strong>Psychiatric tradition</strong>: case studies</p>

<p>Anna O: blind (nothing wrong with eyes), hand paralysed
  but not the arm (impossible physiologically)</p>

<p>
  <strong>Naturalistic Observation</strong>: just watch</p>

<p>Jane Goodall: watched chimps and learnt about them</p>

<p>Probably can't do on humans, because humans know you're
  there</p>

<p>
  <strong>Survey Research</strong>: great way to sample</p>

<p>Problem of representativeness: only those who do the
  surveys are represented</p>

<p>Correlation can be found</p>

<p>
  <strong>Correlation != Causation</strong>(e.g. just because
  violent kids watched violent TV, it doesn't mean violent TV
  causes child violence. Maybe violent kids LIKE violent
  TV!)</p>

<p>Does A cause B or B cause A? or C causes both A and B?
  or...</p>

<p>Surveys can't solve these problems</p>

<p>Correlation finds the link, Causation explains the
  link</p>

<h3>&#160;Research Methods - Surveys &amp; Establishing
  Representativeness&#160;</h3>

<p>Random Sampling: take big group, take small subset and do
  survey on them</p>

<p>Random Assignment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Surveys need to ask unbiased questions to avoid:</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Anchoring effects</strong>(is the Mississippi river
    longer or shorter than *500* miles? How long is it?)
    and
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Framing effects</strong>(Question 0. Question 1.
    how do you now feel about capital punishment?)
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>&#160;Correlation is not Causation: How do you Establish
  Causation?&#160;</h3>

<p>When one variable changes, the other changes as well.
  Why?</p>

<p>Time order is one of the things you want to know. Which
  one happens first?</p>

<p>
  <strong>Surveys can't be done "over time".</strong>
</p>

<p>Elimination of all other causes: random assignment
  (randomly assign people to random causes)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Independent variable</li>
  <li>Experimental group watches TV</li>
  <li>Control group does not watch TV</li>
  <li>Dependent variable (for example)</li>
  <li>Experimental group beats kids up</li>
  <li>Control group kids get beaten up</li>
</ul>
<p>Want this variable to be valid (measure what it is
  supposed to) and reliable (same result every time).</p>

<p>
  <strong>Time-order</strong>is built in, because TV-watching
  must be done first.</p>

<h2>&#160;The Nervous System and the Brain</h2>

<p>Peripheral nervous system: every nerve cell (neurons) that
  isn't the brain or the spinal cord (the central nervous
  system)</p>

<p>Endocrine system: hornomes and chemicals</p>

<h3>&#160;The Neuron</h3>

<p>
  <img style="float: right; width: 300px;"
       src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Neuron_with_oligodendrocyte_and_myelin_sheath.svg/500px-Neuron_with_oligodendrocyte_and_myelin_sheath.svg.png"
       alt=""/>
</p>

<p>The long thing: Axon</p>

<p>Axons have terminal branches</p>

<p>
  <strong>Myelin Sheath: not found in brain
    neurons</strong>(that's why signals in the spinal cord travel
  faster). Helps signals travel faster</p>

<p>Cell body: the back end of the neuron</p>

<p>Has dendrites</p>

<p>Sea slugs have huge neurons, and it can be seen.</p>

<p>Pores open</p>

<p>Ions of one charge (say, +ve) flow in</p>

<p>Ions flow out at a different location</p>

<p>Pores open at different location, ...</p>

<p>Action Potential travels through axon to the synapse.</p>

<p>Synapse</p>

<p>synaptic gap: the gap between the two neurons</p>

<p>Neurotransmitters, emitted from vesicles, exit the axon
  terminal</p>

<p>They arrive at receptor sites</p>

<p>(a period of time during which the synapse cannot fire an
  impulse)</p>

<p>
  <strong>Axon terminal reuptakes neurotransmitters from
    receptors</strong>(can fire again!)</p>

<h3>&#160;Neurotransmitters&#160;</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Dopamine</strong>: common in the brain, important
    for emotions and movement coordination
  </li>
  <li>Parkinson's disease: deficiency of dopamine</li>
  <li>Schizophrenia: excess of dopamine</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Serotonin</strong>: mood, hunger, sleep,
    arousal
  </li>
  <li>Insomnia: deficiency of serotonin</li>
  <li>Depression: deficiency of serotonin</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Norepinephrine</strong>: Alertness, arousal
  </li>
  <li>Depression: deficiency of norephinephrine</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Acetylcholine (most common)</strong>
  </li>
  <li>Runs all muscles</li>
  <li>Alzheimer's Disease (memory): neurons that process
    acetylcholine get damaged
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Endorphines</strong>: Related to heroine and
    morphine
  </li>
  <li>Pain relief</li>
</ul>
<h4>&#160;How Drugs Affect Neurotransmitters</h4>

<p>Mimickry</p>

<p>As agonist: mimic neurotransmitters, pretend a signal is
  sent</p>

<p>As antagonist: go into receptor sites and stick there -
  prevents signals from being sent</p>

<h3>&#160;Divisions of the Nervous System&#160;</h3>

<p>Peripheral</p>

<p>
  <strong>Somatic NS</strong>: things you can control</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Autonomic NS</strong>: things you can't control,
    i.e. pupils dilating
  </li>
  <li>Controls Glands and organ muscles (e.g. hiccups)</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sympathetic</strong>: arousing, Happens when
    stressed
  </li>
  <li>Pupils dilate</li>
  <li>Heart rate ++</li>
  <li>Stomach contracts</li>
  <li>Liver releases sugars</li>
  <li>Adrenal gland releases adrenaline</li>
  <li>Bladder relaxes (wet beds)</li>
  <li>Ejaculation (??)</li>
  <li>Fight or flight</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Parasympathetic</strong>: calming, Lets you build
    up the energy
  </li>
  <li>Pupils contract</li>
  <li>Heart rate --</li>
  <li>Stomach digests food</li>
  <li>Liver processes sugars</li>
  <li>Erections (??)</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Central</strong>
  </li>
  <li>Brain: does most of the thinking</li>
  <li>Brain stem (at the base of the brain): all vital
    functions
  </li>
  <li>Lymbic system (all around the brain stem): motivation,
    emotion, memory
  </li>
  <li>Cerebral cortex (everything else?): separates us from
    animals
  </li>
  <li>Spinal cord: carries peripheral --&gt; brain</li>
  <li>Controls some 'thinking', i.e. reflexes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&#160;How the Spinal Cord Controls Reflexes</h3>

<p>Sensory neuron (tells spine what's happening): muscle
  --&gt; spinal cord</p>

<p>Interneuron: sensory neuron --&gt; motor neuron</p>

<p>Can be controlled by the brain, so reflexes can be
  overridden</p>

<p>Motor neuron (makes muscles do stuff): spinal cord --&gt;
  muscle</p>

<h3>&#160;The Brain</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Brain stem</strong>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Medulla</strong>: heart beat and breathing</p>

<p>in the path of the spinal cord; breaking your neck usually
  breaks this</p>

<p>
  <strong>Reticular formation</strong>: attention, alert,
  reactivity</p>

<p>on top of medulla</p>

<p>
  <strong>Thalamus</strong>: sensory switching point (so we can
  think about what we feel)</p>

<p>the 'little egg thing' at the middle of the brain</p>

<p>
  <strong>Cerebellum</strong>(small brain): movement,
  coordination (balance)</p>

<p>The Lymbic System</p>

<p>
  <strong>Pituitary gland</strong>: produces important
  hormones</p>

<p>Attached to the hypothalamus</p>

<p>
  <strong>Hypothalamus</strong>: linked to hunger, controls
  pituitary gland</p>

<p>Sometimes has stuff to do with pleasure</p>

<p>
  <strong>Amygdala</strong>: anger</p>

<p>Thing under the little egg</p>

<p>
  <strong>Hippocampus</strong>: memory</p>

<p>Cerebral Cortex (big brain)</p>

<p>Occipital lobe: the back of the brain</p>

<p>Vision</p>

<p>Parietal lobe: the one in front of the occipital lobe</p>

<p>Language</p>

<p>Spatial recognition</p>

<p>Temporal lobe: bottom of the brain, right AT the ears</p>

<p>Hearing, memory, mood</p>

<p>Frontal lobe: the front</p>

<p>Reasoning, thinking, complex processing</p>

<p>There is a groove in the frontal lobe (motor cortex) that
  touches the parietal lobe (sensory cortex)</p>

<p>Along that groove, a body can be laid out virtually...</p>

<p>Stimulating the part on the motor cortex controls
  muscles</p>

<p>Seizures: too much activity here</p>

<p>Stimulating the part on the sensory cortex lets person
  feel the body part being stimulated (without actually being
  stimulated there)</p>

<p>Epilepsy: too much activity here</p>

<p>A stroke along this groove can disable either movement
  (paralysis) or sense (loss of pain). Kinda fun.</p>

<p>Corpus Callosum: cross between the two sides of the
  brain</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cutting the two parts apart reduces seizures. from
    this, people find:
  </li>
  <li>Left side of the brain: more verbal, language</li>
  <li>Right side: visual processing</li>
</ul>
<p>Mike Gazanaga Study: right brain flashed "Get Up", yet
  left brain doesn't know why. Left brain makes stuff up even
  if it knows it's wrong.</p>

<h3>The Endocrine System</h3>

<h3>Overarching Principles&#160;</h3>

<p>Structures of the brain work together in coordinated,
  overlapping, and redundant systems. That means, if one part
  is damaged, other parts take over.</p>

<h2>Behaviourism</h2>

<p>&#160;</p>

<h3>Language Acquisition&#160;- How is it that we learn to
  speak?</h3>

<p>Skinner: yes, we learn language through reinforcement ("oh
  he's talking, isn't he cute")</p>

<p>Chomsky: innate ability to learn language (kids learn
  incredibly quickly, and hear all ranges of sound)</p>

<h2>Developmental Psychology</h2>

<p>Nature vs Nurture</p>

<p>Behaviourist: nurture. Can learn all things through
  rewards</p>

<p>Others: nature. Ability to learn is innate.</p>

<p>Physical: Will study young and old (where the action
  is)</p>

<p>Cognitive: Piaget</p>

<p>Social: Attachment, Erikson, Gender development</p>

<h3>Physical Development&#160;</h3>

<p>If a child can roll over, it prevents itself from sudden
  infant death syndrome</p>

<p>Holding rattle means ability to use hands</p>

<p>Sitting without support happens almost the same time as
  Standing while holding on (5 mons) --&gt; dramatic change</p>

<p>Walking happens a month after Standing</p>

<p>Walking is not pre-programmed (each child learns it its
  own way)</p>

<h3>Old age: decrease in senses (vision, hearing, smell)</h3>

<p>Hearing worsens earlier</p>

<p>Fatal car accidents: U-shaped (25-70 being the trough)</p>

<h3>Gender Development</h3>

<p>One observation is that kids follow their gender
  stereotypes.</p>

<p>Disprove theory: parents' treatment determines what they
  like</p>

<p>Much like an accent, gender stereptypes are picked up from
  the environment</p>

<p>Social learning theory: girls get rewarded from acting
  like girls, boys get... (vice versa)</p>

<p>Gender schema theory: culture give you a gender schema
  (look at the world as one of the genders)</p>

<h2>Cognitive Psychology I - Memory</h2>

<p>How things get in and get out of the brain</p>

<p>Effortful memory</p>

<p>things that we try to learn and remember</p>

<p>Memory without awareness (Non-effortful memory)</p>

<p>remembering things you don't know</p>

<p>Fragility of memory</p>

<p>Memory breaks down and what you remember isn't what
  exactly happened</p>

<h3>Effortful Memory - Cues that Influence Memory&#160;</h3>

<p>basic ideas can be dramatically influenced by cues.
  semantic cues can be very helpful.</p>

<p>Self reference effect: pick cues related to SELF CONCEPT
  (how it is relevant to you).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Context effect: we remember things better if we're in
    the same state when we learnt it
  </li>
  <li>i.e. if you get drunk while studying, you recall better
    in the exam if you are drunk
  </li>
  <li>e.g. mood</li>
  <li>e.g. scuba divers recall better in water if they also
    remembered in water.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>remembering words is easier than remembering meaningless
  syllables.</p>

  <strong>semantic (type of) &gt; acoustic (rhymes with) &gt;
    visual (capitals)</strong>

<p>We remember only what we want to remember</p>
<ul>
  <li>We often paint ourselves in a positive light as we
    think about the future
  </li>
  <li>Conversely, it's not easy to forget what we want to
    forget. It actually works the opposite way (what we want to
    forget keeps coming back)

  </li>
  <li>These memories can be recalled via hypnosis or guided
    memory... but are they fake?
  </li>
  <li>Memories are more accurate if person has some
    recollection of that memory
  </li>
  <li>Memories are less accurate if recalled when drugged
    (with sodium pentathol), with guided imagery (hypnosis), or

<h3>Judgment under uncertainty</h3>

<p>Heuristics in judgment</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence</p>

<h3>Perception&#160;</h3>

<p>Our thoughts and preconceptions shape what we
  perceive.</p>

<p>We don't perceive reality. We perceive our take on
  reality.</p>

<p>We see through our preconceptions.</p>

<p>The whole is not the sum of its parts</p>

<p>You saw a dog inside a bunch of dots. The dog is not
  there.</p>

<p>Figure is what stands out (the apparent thing)</p>

<p>Ground is what's behind (the unapparent thing)</p>

<p>The vase that reveals two faces: vase is the figure, faces
  are the ground</p>

<h3>&#160;Our Knowledge and Preconceptions Shape Our
  Perceptions&#160;</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Muller-Lyer Illusion</li>
  <li>&lt;---&gt;---&lt; (BC IS LONGER!!!)</li>
  <li>Believes that western people live in buildings have
    angles that cue which angle the wall is pointing.
  </li>
  <li>Ponzo Illusion</li>
  <li>Something "farther", though the same size on the
    picture, appears larger. Example: red blocks on a highway,
    cars parked on the side
  </li>
  <li>The Ames Room</li>
  <li>Slanted floors and distorted angles make one person
    look much taller than the other
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Perceptual Set</strong>
  </li>
  <li>A picture that gets people ready to perceive the next
    picture as the same as the picture you first see (e.g.
    saxophone and woman)
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Judgment Under Uncertainty: Schemas and
  Heuristics&#160;</h3>

<p>Thoughts are influenced by the way we think about the
  world.</p>

<p>Schemas are the ways we think about the world - shortcuts,
  summaries, and how we come to understand the world</p>

<p>We need schemas because we can't remember everything, so
  we need to figure out what's important and what isn't</p>

<h3>Heuristics are simple ways to think about things -
  shortcuts, strategies we use to make decisions</h3>

<p>Representative heuristic: Linda is single, outspoken, ...
  97% of the people chose B (bank teller AND feminist) over A
  (bank teller) when B is a subset of A.</p>

<p>Availability heuristic: 3 times more words are of "k" at
  third letter than of first letter, but because first letter
  is much easier to think about, you say first letter</p>

<p>Availability heuristic: "if you go to the middle east,
  should you be more concerned about traffic accidents or
  terrorist attacks?"</p>

<h3>Judgment Under Uncertainty: Focus on University of
  Waterloo Research Priming and Time Judgments (Dr. Jennifer
  Stolz)&#160;</h3>

<p>By priming a concept, judgments about timing can be
  affected, so you believe you see something sooner.</p>

<p>- half is primed with 'bacon', half is not</p>

<p>- all are flashed two words almost simultaneously (water,
  egg)</p>

<p>- all are asked which word came first</p>

<p>so many say that eggs came first (because bacon primed
  it)</p>

<h3>Judgment Under Uncertainty: Artificial Intelligence - Do
  people think like computers?&#160;</h3>

<p>If you can make computers think like humans, then you will
  have known how humans think, right?</p>

<p>Terms "encoding", "storage" and "retrieval" of memory came
  from computer models.</p>

<p>Heuristics don't make logical sense like a computer would,
  but it's hard to make a computer use heuristics like we
  do</p>

<h3>Evaluating psychotherapies</h3>

<p>hypnosis creates false memories</p>

<p>we can't ask patient if they got better (they want to get
  better -&gt; they say they're getting better)</p>

<p>we can't ask psychiatrist if patient got better (they need
  to show progress and get paid)</p>

<p>pretest + posttest, measure something</p>

<p>problem: people show up to therapy when they are at their
  worst (spontaneous remission), so they must get better with
  or without therapy</p>

<p>problem: guessing again will likely get you a higher
  score; same concept for therapy scores</p>

<p>fix: provide with standard, known effective treatment with
  new, maybe-more-effective treatment</p>

<p>pick an indicator as a measurement</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dr.Oakman on social phobias: a book is cheaper than
    hi-tech equipment, and just as effective
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>COST EFFECTIVENESS</strong>of psychotherapy means
    that the first guided self help method will be more
    commonly used

  <li>is psychotherapy effective?</li>
  <li>yes (bell curve shifts upwards), but not by a great
    amount (untreated and treated overlap by a significant
    amount)

    better than another
  </li>
  <li>for certain types of disorders, some is better (i.e.

<p>training does not matter</p>

<h2>Social Psychology</h2>

<p>Almost all psychologists' roots trace back to Kurt Lewin -
  the father of social psychology</p>

<p>Behaviour is a function of the person and the
  situation</p>

<p>Anytime one is looking at behaviour, e power of the
  situation must be examined as well</p>

<p>PROBLEM: most people believe that they're not controlled
  by the situation - they do what they want to do</p>

<p>&#160;Social psychologists think that most people are the
  same, in that they are affected by the same situation at the
  same time</p>

<p>Perceiver shapes reality</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Fundamental attribution error</strong>
  </li>
  <li>"Why did someone do what they did?" -&gt; tries to find
    a reason for it, often incorrectly
  </li>
  <li>Stereotyping</li>
  <li>Perceiver shapes reality: distortion of reality</li>
  <li>Some stereotypes are more acceptable, e.g. ethnic group
    vs lawyers (this also being a stereotype)
  </li>
  <li>Stereotype threat</li>
  <li>Women's performance on math tests</li>
  <li>If told both men and women "there is no gender
    difference", they did test equally well
  </li>
  <li>If told both men and women "there IS gender
    difference", men did better, women did worse
  </li>
  <li>(despite the fact that nobody said if men or women are
    better for the test)
  </li>
  <li>Davies, Spencer, Quinn, Gerhardstein</li>
  <li>If women are shown "girly" TV ads prior to a test, they
    do worse at math
  </li>
  <li>If women are shown "neutral" ads prior to a test, they
    do better at math
  </li>
  <li>TV commercials DON'T affect men.</li>
  <li>This also works for "picking quantitative/verbal majors
    in college"
  </li>
  <li>Again, men are not affected, but women switch to
    wanting more verbal majors.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Achievement Motivation</h2>

<p>Leadership style</p>

<p>Fiedler's research wants to see which leaders are great
  leaders</p>

<p>Social leader, or Punishment leader, is better leadership
  style?</p>

<p>Social leader is generally good, except in two conditions:
  team really sucks, or team is really good</p>

<h2>Psychology of health</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Placebo effect</li>
  <li>works for high blood pressure, heart attacks,
    angina
  </li>
  <li>not as well as advertised because people often seek
    medication at their worst (regression to the mean)
  </li>
  <li>very effective in dealing with pain</li>
  <li>Stress
    <ul>
      <li>Type I stress: too many things to do</li>
      <li>If you feel in control, it is not nearly as
        stressful
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>

          <li>"I'm sure, I accept challenge" --&gt; focus</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Type II stress: feels bad not feeling bad enough</li>
  <li>Phases</li>
  <li>Phase I: stressor triggers alarm (resources
    mobilised)
  </li>
  <li>Phase II: coping with stressor</li>

  </li>
  <li> Some other dude called John Watson started behaviourism.
  </li>
  <li> 1b2 - Psychiatric Tradition</li>
  <li> Freud dominated this tradition</li>
  <li> Believes in SEX and aggression as two major motives.</li>
  <li> Oedipus complex (boys want to have sex with their mummies)
    is no longer believed as adult development theory because it
    doesn't explain how girls developed
  </li>
  <li> Carl Jung: some brilliant literarian</li>
  <li> Carl Adler: instead of SEX, people want to be in charge
    (related to self-esteem)
  </li>
  <li> Ego psychologists: the follow-up of Freudian tradition
  </li>
  <li> Erik Erickson: social development</li>
  <li> Karen Horney &amp; Henry Stack Sullivan: relationships
    [between parents and children] / self-concept
  </li>
  <li> Assumptions of the psychiatric tradition</li>
  <li> Assumes thought is unconscious, so cannot rely on what
    people tell you
  </li>
  <li> Studies one person, comprehensively, in therapy (slow)
  </li>
  <li> Better at studying sick people than those who are normal
  </li>
  <li> Prof used "psyche" as a noun here</li>
  <li> 1b3 - Testing Tradition</li>
  <li> Galton / Darwin (cousins)</li>
  <li> Galton wants to find out why people are geniuses / "more
    fit for survival"
  </li>
  <li> Connects with Darwin's theory of evolution</li>
  <li> Strangely, he used physical tasks to measure intelligence
    (lol, derp)
  </li>
  <li> Galton's student, Spearman, developed lots of statistical
    techniques for psychology, still used today
  </li>
  <li> Cattel &amp; Eysenek (iSink): what makes up a person</li>
  <li> Introversion / extroversion</li>
  <li> Neutoticism (what makes people worrysome)</li>
  <li> Binet: how to do an intelligence test (aka school
    testing)
  </li>
  <li> Instead of riding bikes, they now do what is learnt in
    schools
  </li>
  <li> But he did tests based on age, not school grade</li>
  <li> Assumptions of the testing tradition</li>
  <li> Assumes psychology is the byproduct of biology</li>
  <li> There are few ways which people differ</li>
  <li> Assumes traits can be understood through simple tasks. So,
    their tests are done with questionnaires
  </li>
  <li> 1b4 - Academic Tradition</li>
  <li> This will make up 70~80% of the course.</li>
  <li> Wundt: Psychological Atomism</li>
  <li> Tries to divide thoughts into mini units (and fails)</li>
  <li> Did something about reaction times</li>
  <li> William James: Pragmatism</li>
  <li> Studies what people cared about, and not what they think
    about
  </li>
  <li> Watson &amp; Skinner: took Wundt's stuff and made it more
    scientific
  </li>
  <li> Only study what is observable, i.e. behaviour</li>
  <li> Lewin: Gestalt psychology (the prof's favourite
    psychologist)
  </li>
  <li> Says Wundt is not wrong because the whole does not add up
    to the sum of the parts
  </li>
  <li> Assumptions of the Academic Tradition</li>
  <li> Psychology is best understood when the causes are
    understood (cause &amp; effect)
  </li>
  <li> Why &gt; How or When, because if you know why, you know
    how and when.
  </li>
  <li> Thoughts and actions can be understood; people can be
    understood by observing them
  </li>
  <li> 1b5 - Three New Beginnings In Psychology</li>
  <li> Psychiatric (1st wave)</li>
  <li> Behavioural (2nd wave)</li>
  <li> Humanistic (3rd wave) approach</li>
  <li> Carl Rogers: reflect back to what people were feeling</li>
  <li> Wants people to understand their inner selves</li>
  <li> Trait Tradition</li>
  <li> Expands neutoticism and extroversion to 5 personality
    traits: OCEAN
  </li>
  <li> O: openness = intelligence (want to learn)</li>
  <li> C: conscientiousness = get stuff done</li>
  <li> E: extroversion</li>
  <li> A: agreeableness = how positive or negative you are</li>
  <li> N: neutoticism</li>
  <li> Academic Tradition: cognitive revolution</li>
  <li> Albert Bandura: with behaviourism, a bunch of stuff cannot
    be explained
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>1c1 - Basic Philosophy of Science</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Skepticism -&gt; "Our ideas can often be wrong" -&gt;
    encourages testing
  </li>
  <li> Demonstrate how our ideas are wrong. If you can't prove
    you wrong, then you are probably right for now... (and accept
    thus)
  </li>
  <li> What is accepted is often what is popular (the experiments
    that are done)
  </li>
  <li> Influenced by political and social forces</li>
</ul>
<h2>1c2 - Ways of Doing Research</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Discovery needs explanation to make sense</li>
  <li> Discovery: astronomy (find stuff)</li>
  <li> Explanation: chemistry (make sense of stuff)</li>
  <li> Phychology thinks it is at the middle</li>
  <li> Psychiatric tradition: case studies</li>
  <li> Anna O: blind (nothing wrong with eyes), hand paralysed
    but not the arm (impossible physiologically)
  </li>
  <li> Naturalistic Observation: just watch</li>
  <li> Jane Goodall: watched chimps and learnt about them</li>
  <li> Probably can't do on humans, because humans know you're
    there
  </li>
  <li> Survey Research: great way to sample</li>
  <li> Problem of representativeness: only those who do the
    surveys are represented
  </li>
  <li> Correlation can be found</li>
  <li> Correlation != Causation (e.g. just because violent kids
    watched violent TV, it doesn't mean violent TV causes child
    violence. Maybe violent kids LIKE violent TV!)
  </li>
  <li> Does A cause B or B cause A? or C causes both A and B?
    or...
  </li>
  <li> Surveys can't solve these problems</li>
  <li> Correlation finds the link, Causation explains the link
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>1c3 - Research Methods - Surveys &amp; Establishing
  Representativeness</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Random Sampling: take big group, take small subset and do
    survey on them
  </li>
  <li> Random Assignment:</li>
  <li> Surveys need to ask unbiased questions to avoid:</li>
  <li> - Anchoring effects (is the Mississippi river longer or
    shorter than *500* miles? How long is it?) and
  </li>
  <li> - Framing effects (Question 0. Question 1. how do you now
    feel about capital punishment?)
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>1c4 - Correlation is not Causation: How do you Establish
  Causation?</h2>
<ul>
  <li> When one variable changes, the other changes as well.
    Why?
  </li>
  <li> Time order is one of the things you want to know. Which
    one happens first?
  </li>
  <li> Surveys can't be done "over time".</li>
  <li> Elimination of all other causes: random assignment
    (randomly assign people to random causes)
  </li>
  <li> Independent variable</li>
  <li> Experimental group watches TV</li>
  <li> Control group does not watch TV</li>
  <li> Dependent variable (for example)</li>
  <li> Experimental group beats kids up</li>
  <li> Control group kids get beaten up</li>
  <li> Want this variable to be valid (measure what it is
    supposed to) and reliable (same result every time).
  </li>
  <li> Time-order is built in, because TV-watching must be done
    first.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>2a - The Nervous System and the Brain - The Big Picture</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Peripheral nervous system: every nerve cell (neurons) that
    isn't the brain or the spinal cord (the central nervous
    system)
  </li>
  <li> Endocrine system: hornomes and chemicals</li>
</ul>
<h2>2b1 - The Neuron</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The long thing: Axon</li>
  <li> Axons have terminal branches</li>
  <li> Myelin Sheath: not found in brain neurons (that's why
    signals in the spinal cord travel faster)
  </li>
  <li> Helps signals travel faster</li>
  <li> Cell body: the back end of the neuron</li>
  <li> Has dendrites</li>
  <li> Sea slugs have huge neurons, and it can be seen.</li>
  <li> Pores open</li>
  <li> Ions of one charge (say, +ve) flow in</li>
  <li> Ions flow out at a different location</li>
  <li> Pores open at different location, ...</li>
  <li> Action Potential travels through axon to the synapse.</li>
  <li> Synapse</li>
  <li> synaptic gap: the gap between the two neurons</li>
  <li> Neurotransmitters, emitted from vesicles, exit the axon
    terminal
  </li>
  <li> They arrive at receptor sites</li>
  <li> (a period of time during which the synapse cannot fire an
    impulse)
  </li>
  <li> Axon terminal reuptakes neurotransmitters from receptors
  </li>
  <li> (can fire again!)</li>
</ul>
<h2>2b2 - Neurotransmitters</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Dopamine</li>
  <li> Common in the brain</li>
  <li> Important for emotions and movement coordination</li>
  <li> Parkinson's disease: deficiency of dopamine</li>
  <li> Schizophrenia: excess of dopamine</li>
  <li> Serotonin</li>
  <li> Mood, hunger, sleep, arousal</li>
  <li> Insomnia: deficiency of serotonin</li>
  <li> Depression: deficiency of serotonin</li>
  <li> Norepinephrine</li>
  <li> Alertness, arousal</li>
  <li> Depression: deficiency of norephinephrine</li>
  <li> Acetylcholine (most common)</li>
  <li> Runs all muscles</li>
  <li> Alzheimer's Disease (memory): neurons that process
    acetylcholine get damaged
  </li>
  <li> Endorphines</li>
  <li> Pain relief</li>
  <li> Related to heroine and morphine</li>
</ul>
<h2>2b3 - How Drugs Affect Neurotransmitters</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Mimickry</li>
  <li> As agonist: mimic neurotransmitters, pretend a signal is
    sent
  </li>
  <li> As antagonist: go into receptor sites and stick there -
    prevents signals from being sent
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>2c, 2c1, 2c2 - Divisions of the Nervous System</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Peripheral</li>
  <li> Somatic NS: things you can control</li>
  <li> Autonomic NS: things you can't control, i.e. pupils
    dilating
  </li>
  <li> Controls Glands and organ muscles (e.g. hiccups)</li>
  <li> Sympathetic: arousing, Happens when stressed</li>
  <li> Pupils dilate</li>
  <li> Heart rate ++</li>
  <li> Stomach contracts</li>
  <li> Liver releases sugars</li>
  <li> Adrenal gland releases adrenaline</li>
  <li> Bladder relaxes (wet beds)</li>
  <li> Ejaculation (??)</li>
  <li> Fight or flight</li>
  <li> Parasympathetic: calming, Lets you build up the energy
  </li>
  <li> Pupils contract</li>
  <li> Heart rate --</li>
  <li> Stomach digests food</li>
  <li> Liver processes sugars</li>
  <li> Erections (??)</li>
  <li> Central</li>
  <li> Brain: does most of the thinking</li>
  <li> Brain stem (at the base of the brain): all vital
    functions
  </li>
  <li> Lymbic system (all around the brain stem): motivation,
    emotion, memory
  </li>
  <li> Cerebral cortex (everything else?): separates us from
    animals
  </li>
  <li> Spinal cord: carries peripheral --&gt; brain</li>
  <li> Controls some 'thinking', i.e. reflexes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2c3 - How the Spinal Cord Controls Reflexes</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Sensory neuron (tells spine what's happening): muscle --&gt;
    spinal cord
  </li>
  <li> Interneuron: sensory neuron --&gt; motor neuron</li>
  <li> Can be controlled by the brain, so reflexes can be
    overridden
  </li>
  <li> Motor neuron (makes muscles do stuff): spinal cord --&gt;
    muscle
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>2c4 - The Brain</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Brain stem</li>
  <li> Medulla: heart beat and breathing</li>
  <li> in the path of the spinal cord; breaking your neck usually
    breaks this
  </li>
  <li> Reticular formation: attention, alert, reactivity</li>
  <li> on top of medulla</li>
  <li> Thalamus: sensory switching point (so we can think about
    what we feel)
  </li>
  <li> the 'little egg thing' at the middle of the brain</li>
  <li> Cerebellum (small brain): movement, coordination
    (balance)
  </li>
  <li> The Lymbic System</li>
  <li> Pituitary gland: produces important hormones</li>
  <li> Attached to the hypothalamus</li>
  <li> Hypothalamus: linked to hunger, controls pituitary gland
  </li>
  <li> Sometimes has stuff to do with pleasure</li>
  <li> Amygdala: anger</li>
  <li> Thing under the little egg</li>
  <li> Hippocampus: memory</li>
  <li> Cerebral Cortex (big brain)</li>
  <li> Occipital lobe: the back of the brain</li>
  <li> Vision</li>
  <li> Parietal lobe: the one in front of the occipital lobe</li>
  <li> Language</li>
  <li> Spatial recognition</li>
  <li> Temporal lobe: bottom of the brain, right AT the ears</li>
  <li> Hearing, memory, mood</li>
  <li> Frontal lobe: the front</li>
  <li> Reasoning, thinking, complex processing</li>
  <li> There is a groove in the frontal lobe (motor cortex) that
    touches the parietal lobe (sensory cortex)
  </li>
  <li> Along that groove, a body can be laid out virtually...
  </li>
  <li> Stimulating the part on the motor cortex controls
    muscles
  </li>
  <li> Seizures: too much activity here</li>
  <li> Stimulating the part on the sensory cortex lets person
    feel the body part being stimulated (without actually being
    stimulated there)
  </li>
  <li> Epilepsy: too much activity here</li>
  <li> A stroke along this groove can disable either movement
    (paralysis) or sense (loss of pain). Kinda fun.
  </li>
  <li> Corpus Callosum: cross between the two sides of the
    brain
  </li>
  <li> Cutting the two parts apart reduces seizures. from this,
    people find:
  </li>
  <li> - Left side of the brain: more verbal, language</li>
  <li> - Right side: visual processing</li>
  <li> Left-handers are funnier.</li>
  <li> Mike Gazanaga Study: right brain flashed "Get Up", yet
    left brain doesn't know why. Left brain makes stuff up even
    if it knows it's wrong.
  </li>
  <li>=== 2d - The Endocrine System ===</li>
</ul>
<h2>2e - Putting it together</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Stomach contractions --&gt; peripheral NS</li>
  <li> Bloog sugar levels --&gt; pancreas --&gt; hypothalamus --&gt;
    orexin
  </li>
  <li> Orexin: hunger hormone</li>
  <li> Damage to the hypothalamus can allow starvation to death
    or never stop eating
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>2f - Overarching Principles</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Structures of the brain work together in coordinated,
    overlapping, and redundant systems. That means, if one part
    is damaged, other parts take over.
  </li>
  <li> === 3a1 - Vision ===</li>
  <li> Vision and hearing respond to physical stimuli.</li>
  <li> Pupil controls amount of light</li>
  <li> Lens controls focus of light onto retina</li>
  <li> Retina</li>
  <li> Closest to the lens is Ganglion cell (bunches up
    signals)
  </li>
  <li> Middle: bipolar cell (bunches up signals)</li>
  <li> Furthest: rods/cones (explains why you sometimes see
    veins)
  </li>
  <li> Psych101 ignores evolution as the reason why rods/cones
    are outside instead of inside, telling you how light is too
    strong and everything
  </li>
  <li> Fovea is the most sensitive part of retina</li>
  <li> Optic nerve (where the blind spot is) goes to the brain
  </li>
  <li> Left and right-eye signals cross at the Optic Chiasm, then
    goes to the thalamus for first-stage processing.
  </li>
  <li> It then goes to the visual cortex. Visual cortex performs
    feature detection.
  </li>
  <li> Feature detection: cells detection lines at various
    angles
  </li>
  <li> Theory of colour vision</li>
  <li> Young-Helmholtz Trichromatic Theory</li>
  <li> Studies the retina, finds 3 types of cones for 3 primary
    colours
  </li>
  <li> Experiment is consistent with colourblind persons (can't
    see red, can't see green, ...)
  </li>
  <li> EXCEPT YELLOW</li>
  <li> The Opponent-Process Theory of Colour Vision</li>
  <li> 3 sets of opposite pairs of colours: B/W, R/G, Blue/Yellow
    &lt;-- yellow is artificially synthesised by the thalamus
  </li>
  <li> Afterimage effect: if one colour cones constantly fire,
    they wear out, interpreting as if the opposite colour is
    firing
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>3a2 - Hearing</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Pinna (outer ear), auditory canal (earwax canal), eardrum,
    and cochlea (seashell in inner ear)
  </li>
  <li> Cochlea turns stimulus into neural impulses</li>
  <li> Waves of impact travel through the fluids inside the
    cochlea
  </li>
  <li> Hairs on the cochlear membrane gets bent by the travelling
    fluid
  </li>
  <li> Hair bending --&gt; auditory nerve</li>
  <li> Place Theory: places of the hair in the cochlea determines
    frequency of the sound
  </li>
  <li> This seems to explain high frequency sounds</li>
  <li> Frequency Theory: speed of the wave determineds frequency
    of the sound
  </li>
  <li> This seems to explain low frequency sounds</li>
</ul>
<h2>3a3 - The Other Senses</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Basic tastes: sweet (tip), sour (side back), salty
    (sides), bitter (back)
  </li>
  <li> Taste and smell respond to chemical stimuli. They are
    related to one another.
  </li>
  <li> i.e. spices are actually handled by smell</li>
  <li> There are tons of smells</li>
  <li> Likely detected by chemical reactions that occur in the
    olfactory membrane
  </li>
  <li> Odors strongly invoke memories because of the proximity of
    the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus (place for memory)
  </li>
  <li> Touch</li>
  <li> Pressure, Warmth (not hot), Cold, Pain</li>
  <li> Hot = warm + cold (try washing hand in two streams)</li>
  <li> Wet = cold + pressure</li>
  <li> Itch = lots of pain</li>
  <li> Pain</li>
  <li> There is no brain area for pain</li>
  <li> We tend to remember how painful something was, not for how
    much it was painful
  </li>
  <li> Distractions (using the brain) lowers pain</li>
  <li> Endorphines shut pain 'gates'</li>
  <li> Balance</li>
  <li> If your arm is out, you know it's there</li>
  <li> Two organs: joints/muscles and ear (semicircular canals)
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>3b - Synaesthesia (blending of sensory perception)</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Someone would see blue when he/she sees "4", or even
    calculates math and ends up being "4"
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>3c - How do we read out loud?</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Visual cortex sees word</li>
  <li> Angular gyrus transforms sight into auditory code</li>
  <li> Wernicke's area interprets the meaning of the word (damage
    here makes patient speak bullshit)
  </li>
  <li> Broca's area controls speech (damage here makes patients
    unable to express themselves)
  </li>
  <li> Motor cortex speaks</li>
</ul>
<h2>3d - Brain coordination while we sleep</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Brain is active while we sleep</li>
  <li> While awake: alpha waves (relaxed)</li>
  <li> Stage 1 sleep: light sleep</li>
  <li> Stage 2 sleep: little bundles of burst activity
    ("Spindles")
  </li>
  <li> Stage 3 sleep: higher amplitudes</li>
  <li> Stage 4 sleep: higher amplitudes (delta waves)</li>
  <li> REM sleep: dreaming, activity at about stage 1</li>
  <li> Why we sleep</li>
  <li> feel bad when we don't sleep (no rest, right)</li>
  <li> Activation-synthesis: trying to make sense out of random
    nonsense
  </li>
  <li> Pathways form during the day (learn things) and lit up
    again during dreaming (memory reactivation)
  </li>
  <li> Proof: babies sleep so much (to consolidate memory)</li>
  <li> === 4a - What is behaviourism? ===</li>
  <li> Classical Conditioning - Pavlov and his dogs</li>
  <li> Operant Conditioning - Skinner and his pigeons</li>
  <li> Language Acquisition - How is it that we learn to speak?
  </li>
  <li> Observational Learning - Learn from watching someone do
    something
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>4b - Classical Conditioning</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Pavlov wanted to study spit (why)</li>
  <li> had test tubes hooked up to the saliva glands of dogs to
    collect the spit. He notices that spit is secreted before the
    food goes there...
  </li>
  <li> Normally if a metronome goes up to a dog, the dog doesn't
    spit
  </li>
  <li> Normally if food goes up to a dog, the dog spits</li>
  <li> If food and metronome go up to a dog, the dog spits</li>
  <li> Now if the metronome goes up to a dog, the dog spits</li>
  <li> The metronome is the conditioned (neutral) stimulus</li>
  <li> Learning and unlearning</li>
  <li> In classical conditioning, learning is the association of
    a conditioned stimulus or neutral stimulus with an
    unconditioned stimulus to the extent that the conditioned
    stimulus produces the unconditioned response
  </li>
  <li> John Watson (a behaviourist): the little Albert</li>
  <li> Taught Albert to be afraid of anything soft and furry</li>
  <li> Generalization: learn to be scared of anything similar
  </li>
  <li> scared of rat --&gt; scared of dog --&gt; scared of cat --&gt;
    scared of stuffed animals
  </li>
  <li> Discrimination: reverse of generalization</li>
  <li> learn to be scared of one thing but not another</li>
  <li> Extinction: conditioned stimulus no longer produces the
    response
  </li>
  <li> Occurs if the unconditioned stimulus is no longer paired
    with the conditioned stimuli
  </li>
  <li> Problems with Classical Conditioning</li>
  <li> can't teach them new tricks (dogs spit, albert gets
    afraid)
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>4c - Operant Conditioning</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Learning is the acquisition of new behaviours.</li>
  <li> Behaviour that is rewarded will occur more often; vice
    versa
  </li>
  <li> Nothing about punishment</li>
  <li> Skinner trained pigeons playing Beethoven. What?</li>
  <li> Skinner proposed that (almost) everything is learned via
    operant conditioning
  </li>
  <li> Also thinks that punish leads to inaction, not the desired
    action
  </li>
  <li> Example: grades</li>
  <li> Reinforcers</li>
  <li> Positive: getting good things (e.g. pigeons get food)</li>
  <li> Primary reinforcers: pleasing in its own right</li>
  <li> Conditioned reinforcers: pleasant through association
    (e.g. money)
  </li>
  <li> Links with classical conditioning</li>
  <li> Negative: REMOVING BAD things</li>
  <li> In classical and operant conditioning, thoughts are
    epiphenomenon: things that are there but with no importance
    or influence
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>4d - Language Acquisition</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Skinner: yes, we learn language through reinforcement (oh
    he's talking, isn't he cute)
  </li>
  <li> Chomsky: innate ability to learn language (kids learn
    incredibly quickly, and hear all ranges of sound)
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>4e - Observational Learning</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Bandura: just watch somebody else get rewarded ...?
    (requires thought of what's going on, i.e. "it will happen to
    me too")
  </li>
  <li> Bobo doll gets beaten up 31x more often if kid sees adult
    doing it too
  </li>
  <li> Explains violence on TV</li>
</ul>
<h2>4f - The Big Picture</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Nature vs Nurture</li>
  <li> Behaviourist: nurture. Can learn all things through
    rewards
  </li>
  <li> Others: nature. Ability to learn is innate.</li>
  <li> === 5a - Developmental Psychology II: The Big Picture
    ===
  </li>
  <li> Physical: Will study young and old (where the action is)
  </li>
  <li> Cognitive: Piaget</li>
  <li> Social: Attachment, Erikson, Gender development</li>
</ul>
<h2>5b - Physical Development</h2>
<ul>
  <li> If a child can roll over, it prevents itself from sudden
    infant death syndrome
  </li>
  <li> Holding rattle means ability to use hands</li>
  <li> Sitting without support happens almost the same time as
    Standing while holding on (5 mons) --&gt; dramatic change
  </li>
  <li> Walking happens a month after Standing</li>
  <li> Walking is not pre-programmed (each child learns it its
    own way)
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Old age: decrease in senses (vision, hearing, smell)</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Hearing worsens earlier</li>
  <li> Fatal car accidents: U-shaped (25-70 being the trough)
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>5c1 - Cognitive Development: An Introduction to Piaget's
  Theory</h2>
<ul>
  <li> His methodology is different from other psychologists.
  </li>
  <li> He played with kids to get to know them. He would collect
    a bunch of kids and see what they would do.
  </li>
  <li> Schema: a way to think about the world</li>
  <li> Assimilation: add info to the schema, e.g. how to take
    notes in a 600-people classroom
  </li>
  <li> Accomodation: changing the schema to adjust to what you
    know, e.g. this isn't a classroom anymore
  </li>
  <li> He proposes developmental stages, each with a schema (the
    kid thinks differently about the world)
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>5c2 - Cognitive Development: Piaget's Stages of Cognitive
  Development</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Stage 1 (0-2 years)</li>
  <li> Sensorimotor: Object permanence (8 months, but
    controversial): relate to world via senses (putting things in
    their mouth), little thought
  </li>
  <li> if an object is sensed, it is there, else -&gt; it's
    gone!
  </li>
  <li> Stranger anxiety</li>
  <li> can be removed by eliminating who the kid can see,
    including putting him on your own shoulder so he doesn't see
    you
  </li>
  <li> Stage 2 (2-6 years)</li>
  <li> Preoperational: representing things with words, but no
    reeasoning is given
  </li>
  <li> two same volume glasses has different amounts because "one
    looks taller"
  </li>
  <li> lack of conservation</li>
  <li> pretend play</li>
  <li> Egocentrism: views the world from their own perspective,
    cannot see from anyone else's
  </li>
  <li> Stage 3 (7-11 years)</li>
  <li> Concrete operational: Conservation, provided that it is
    still seen
  </li>
  <li> Stage 4 (12+ years)</li>
  <li> Abstract reasoning: stuff no longer needs to be in front
    of them
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>5c3 - Cognitive Development: Extensions and Qualifications of
  Piaget's Theory</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Children learn object permanance earlier than 8 months
  </li>
  <li> 2.5 months: if behind something, it's not there</li>
  <li> 2.5-3.0 months: if behind an arch and cannot see through
    the gap, surprised
  </li>
  <li> if behind a U-shaped thing and cannot see through gap, not
    surprised (shows no height detection)
  </li>
  <li> 3.0-3.5 months: learn about heights of gaps</li>
  <li> Theory of mind</li>
  <li> Develops gradually instead of progressing with the
    elimination of ecocentrism
  </li>
  <li> Summary: progression is much more gradual than distinct
    stages.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>5d1 - Social Development: Attachment Theory</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Harlow's Monkey Studies</li>
  <li> took baby monkeys and raised them with separate mothers
    (one kind with milk, no comfort; one with no milk, but soft)
  </li>
  <li> baby chooses to be in the soft mother, going to the milky
    one only when hungry
  </li>
  <li> Bond with caregiver is the BASIS of all other
    relationships of the child
  </li>
  <li> The Strange Situation</li>
  <li> How the babies respond when their mothers leave</li>
  <li> How the babies respond when their mothers return</li>
  <li> Good bonding (secure attachment): upset at first, but
    happy when returns
  </li>
  <li> Bad bonding (anxious attachment): scream when left, and
    clingy when returns
  </li>
  <li> Avoidant attachment: nothing when left, avoid mother when
    returns
  </li>
  <li> Predictions</li>
  <li> - # friends at school: securely attached kids have more
    kids
  </li>
  <li> - securely attached have better adult relationships</li>
  <li> Lesson: trust can be taught through a loving caregiver
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>5d2 - Social Development: Erikson's Theory</h2>
<ul>
  <li> This (a little Freudian) theory goes to old age</li>
  <li> Stage 1 (0-1 year, infancy)</li>
  <li> Trust vs mistrust: if needs are met</li>
  <li> Stage 2 (1-2 years, toddlerhood)</li>
  <li> Autonomy vs shame/doubt: if they can do things
    themselves
  </li>
  <li> Stage 3 (3-5 years, preschooler)</li>
  <li> Initiative vs guilt: if they can't finish the things they
    initiate, theu feel guilty (failing to complete something)
  </li>
  <li> Stage 4 (6-13 years, elementary school)</li>
  <li> Competence vs inferiority: they learn to accomplish
    something, or else you feel bad
  </li>
  <li> Stage 5 (until 20 years, adolescence)</li>
  <li> Identity vs role confusion: marking identity, or confused
    about who you are/should be
  </li>
  <li> Stage 6 (20-40 years, adulthood)</li>
  <li> Intimacy vs isolation: strive to get a good relationship
    or feel isolated
  </li>
  <li> Stage 7 (40-60 years, middle adulthood)</li>
  <li> Generativity vs stagnation: feel the need to accomplish
    something
  </li>
  <li> Stage 8 (60+ years, late adulthood)</li>
  <li> Integrity vs despair: feel their earlier points in life:
    success or failure
  </li>
  <li> The theory isn't quite right, because these are not
    dependent points.
  </li>
  <li> Also a majorly western idea</li>
  <li> Doesn't tell you who will likely have problems later in
    life
  </li>
  <li> Doesn't explain how premature babies form trust/bonding in
    an incubator
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>5d3 - Social Development: Gender Development</h2>
<ul>
  <li> One observation is that kids follow their gender
    stereotypes.
  </li>
  <li> Disprove theory: parents' treatment determines what they
    like
  </li>
  <li> Much like an accent, gender stereptypes are picked up from
    the environment
  </li>
  <li> Social learning theory: girls get rewarded from acting
    like girls, boys get... (vice versa)
  </li>
  <li> Gender schema theory: culture give you a gender schema
    (look at the world as one of the genders)
  </li>
  <li> === 6a - Cognitive Psychology I - Memory: The Big Picture
    ===
  </li>
  <li> How things get in and get out of the brain</li>
  <li> Effortful memory</li>
  <li> things that we try to learn and remember</li>
  <li> Memory without awareness (Non-effortful memory)</li>
  <li> remembering things you don't know</li>
  <li> Fragility of memory</li>
  <li> Memory breaks down and what you remember isn't what
    exactly happened
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>6b - stages of memory</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Sensory memory</li>
  <li> We only pay attention of some of the things we sense</li>
  <li> We then move this to short term memory. (Encoding)</li>
  <li> Short-term memory (STM)</li>
  <li> Lasts 10-30 seconds</li>
  <li> If we rehearse the information, they get moved into long
    term memory (Storage)
  </li>
  <li> Long-term memory (LTM)</li>
  <li> Retrieval</li>
  <li> Sometimes we have trouble retrieving the information (tip
    of the tongue)
  </li>
  <li> Lost in Storage</li>
</ul>
<h2>6c1 - Effortful Memory - How much do we retain?</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Short term memory</li>
  <li> max time: around 20 seconds (when 95% of the people get
    things wrong)
  </li>
  <li> max capacity: 7 +- 2 (Bell labs = 7 digits)</li>
  <li> Long term memory</li>
  <li> we forget much of what we remembering</li>
  <li> half of us (60% -&gt; 30%) forget the stuff after the
    first day. It then levels off.
  </li>
  <li> we also relearn quicker and quicker.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6c2 - Effortful Memory - Cues that Influence Memory</h2>
<ul>
  <li> basic ideas can be dramatically influenced by cues.
    semantic cues can be very helpful.
  </li>
  <li> Self reference effect: pick cues related to SELF CONCEPT
    (how it is relevant to you).
  </li>
  <li> Context effect: we remember things better if we're in the
    same state when we learnt it (i.e. get drunk while studying,
    remember better in the exam)
  </li>
  <li> e.g. mood</li>
  <li> e.g. scuba divers recall better in water if they also
    remembered in water.
  </li>
  <li> remembering words is easier than remembering meaningless
    syllables.
  </li>
  <li> semantic (type of) &gt; acoustic (rhymes with) &gt; visual
    (capitals)
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>6c2 - Effortful Memory - Interference in Memory</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Interference: new stuff you learn interferes with the old
    stuff you knew
  </li>
  <li> Proactive interference: learning spanish when you're
    french screws up your spanish marks
  </li>
  <li> Retroactive interference: now that you know spanish, you
    screw up your french marks
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>6c3 - Strategies to Improve Memory</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Nmemonics</li>
  <li> Sure it helps you memorise, but you don't need to know
    what list items mean
  </li>
  <li> Chunking</li>
  <li> Grouping things together (merging 7+ things into less than
    7 items in STM)
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>6d - Memory Without Awareness</h2>
<ul>
  <li> You know you learnt it, but you have no idea where you
    learnt it.
  </li>
  <li> List of words, if related to "Tide", will trigger the
    priming of a specific laundry detergent ("Tide")
  </li>
  <li> Golfer who forgot he knew how to play golf still played
    awesome
  </li>
  <li>"Priming will influence memory."</li>
  <li> Despite lacking memory, people can learn various tasks.
  </li>
  <li>"The famous name study" : given long list of names, pick
    list of people who are famous
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>6e - The Fragility of Memory</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The construction of automobile destruction (a catchy
    title)
  </li>
  <li> How fast when they CRASHED/BUMPED into each other? 45/30
    (!!!)
  </li>
  <li> Was there any broken glass in the crash? Crash --&gt;
    Yeah! Bumped --&gt; Nah!
  </li>
  <li> We remember only what we want to remember</li>
  <li> We often paint ourselves in a positive light as we think
    about the future
  </li>
  <li> Conversely, it's not easy to forget what we want to
    forget. It actually works the opposite way (what we want to
    forget keeps coming back)
  </li>
  <li> Post-traumatic disorder</li>
  <li> Recovered memories</li>
  <li> repressed memories from traumatic events in childhood
    cannot be remembered, but will popped back under some
    circumstances
  </li>
  <li> Others believe that memories from childhood are just
    constructions.
  </li>
  <li> Barr remembered smashing a car into a tree, but it never
    happened
  </li>
  <li> These memories can be recalled via hypnosis or guided
    memory... but are they fake?
  </li>
  <li> Memories are more accurate if</li>
  <li> person has some recollection of that memory</li>
  <li> Memories are less accurate if</li>
  <li> recalled when drugged (with sodium pentathol)</li>
  <li> recalled with guided imagery</li>
  <li> the child is young</li>
  <li> === 7a - Cognitive Psychology II: Perception,
    Preconceptions and Judgment ===
  </li>
  <li> Perception - the whole is not the sum of its parts</li>
  <li> Figure and ground in perception</li>
  <li> Gestalt principles</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our knowledge and preconceptions shape our perceptions</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Illusions</li>
  <li> Perceptual set</li>
</ul>
<h2>Judgment under uncertainty</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Heuristics in judgment</li>
  <li> Artificial intelligence</li>
</ul>
<h2>7b - Perception</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Our thoughts and preconceptions shape what we perceive.
  </li>
  <li> Gestalt principles</li>
  <li> We don't perceive reality. We perceive our take on
    reality.
  </li>
  <li> We see through our preconceptions.</li>
  <li> The whole is not the sum of its parts</li>
  <li> You saw a dog inside a bunch of dots. The dog is not
    there.
  </li>
  <li> Figure is what stands out (the apparent thing)</li>
  <li> Ground is what's behind (the unapparent thing)</li>
  <li> The vase that reveals two faces: vase is the figure, faces
    are the ground
  </li>
  <li> Gestalt Grouping Principles</li>
  <li> we group things together (|| || ||) is 3 groups of ||, not
    2 groups of || |, because of the lines' proximity with each
    other.
  </li>
  <li> Gestalt Principles of Closure</li>
  <li> when things point at certain directions, you want to Close
    it (invisible shape, invisible triangles)
  </li>
  <li> Gestalt Principles of Good Form</li>
  <li> See things as a whole, even though something (i.e.
    invisible cube) is not there
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>7c - Our Knowledge and Preconceptions Shape Our
  Perceptions</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Muller-Lyer Illusion</li>
  <li>&lt;---&gt;---&lt; (BC IS LONGER!!!)</li>
  <li> Believes that western people live in buildings have angles
    that cue which angle the wall is pointing.
  </li>
  <li> Ponzo Illusion</li>
  <li> Something "farther", though the same size on the picture,
    appears larger. Example: red blocks on a highway, cars parked
    on the side
  </li>
  <li> The Ames Room</li>
  <li> Slanted floors and distorted angles make one person look
    much taller than the other
  </li>
  <li> Perceptual Set</li>
  <li> A picture that gets people ready to perceive the next
    picture as the same as the picture you first see (e.g.
    saxophone and woman)
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>7d1 - Judgment Under Uncertainty: Schemas and Heuristics</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Thoughts are influenced by the way we think about the
    world.
  </li>
  <li> Schemas are the ways we think about the world - shortcuts,
    summaries, and how we come to understand the world
  </li>
  <li> We need schemas because we can't remember everything, so
    we need to figure out what's important and what isn't
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Heuristics are simple ways to think about things - shortcuts,
  strategies we use to make decisions</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Representative heuristic: Linda is single, outspoken, ...
    97% of the people chose B (bank teller AND feminist) over A
    (bank teller) when B is a subset of A.
  </li>
  <li> Availability heuristic: 3 times more words are of "k" at
    third letter than of first letter, but because first letter
    is much easier to think about, you say first letter
  </li>
  <li> Availability heuristic: "if you go to the middle east,
    should you be more concerned about traffic accidents or
    terrorist attacks?"
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>7d2 - Judgment Under Uncertainty: Focus on University of
  Waterloo Research Priming and Time Judgments (Dr. Jennifer
  Stolz)</h2>
<ul>
  <li> By priming a concept, judgments about timing can be
    affected, so you believe you see something sooner.
  </li>
  <li> - half is primed with 'bacon', half is not</li>
  <li> - all are flashed two words almost simultaneously (water,
    egg)
  </li>
  <li> - all are asked which word came first</li>
  <li> so many say that eggs came first (because bacon primed
    it)
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>7d3 - Judgment Under Uncertainty: Artificial Intelligence -
  Do people think like computers?</h2>
<ul>
  <li> If you can make computers think like humans, then you will
    have known how humans think, right?
  </li>
  <li> Terms "encoding", "storage" and "retrieval" of memory came
    from computer models.
  </li>
  <li> Heuristics don't make logical sense like a computer would,
    but it's hard to make a computer use heuristics like we do
  </li>
  <li> === 08a - Clinical Psychology I: Psychological Disorders
    ===
  </li>
  <li> === 08b - Anxiety Disorders ===</li>
  <li> Phobia: irrational fear</li>
  <li> Treatable</li>
  <li> It is interesting to note that it is more likely to be
    afraid of something, or not at all, than to be slightly
    bothered by it.
  </li>
  <li> Phobia sources tend to hurt you (makes sense of being
    afraid of them, but now to irrational degrees)
  </li>
  <li> Generalised Anxiety Disorder - panic disorders</li>
  <li> Overwhelming sense of anxiety</li>
  <li> Not localised as being caused by any particular thing</li>
  <li> Sometimes it can be 'debilitating'</li>
  <li> e.g. Panic Attacks feel like heart will stop</li>
  <li> e.g. Agoraphobia (fear of being in open places) haven't
    left their homes in twenty years
  </li>
  <li> e.g. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</li>
  <li> - Obsession: Repetitive thoughts, e.g. is the stove off?
  </li>
  <li> Germs: 40%</li>
  <li> Catastrophes: 24%</li>
  <li> Symmetry, order, exactness: 17%</li>
  <li> - Compulsion: Repetitive behaviours, e.g. washing</li>
  <li> Excessive washing/grooming: 85%</li>
  <li> Repeating: 51%</li>
  <li> Checking doors, locks, homework: 46%</li>
  <li> can be mild or outright extreme (boy washes hands 2000
    times a day, leaving no time to go poop)
  </li>
  <li> Explaining Anxiety Disorders</li>
  <li> Psychoanalytic perspective: need therapy.</li>
  <li> Little Hans (whom Freud used for his study of the Oedipus
    complex) was afraid of horses. According to Freud:
  </li>
  <li> - Hans wants to have sex with his mother</li>
  <li> - Hans is scared to death that his father will castrate
    him (astration anxiety)
  </li>
  <li> - His dad has large penises, so did the horse</li>
  <li> - Hans transfers anxiety to horses</li>
  <li> Learning perspective: unlearn learnt/conditioned
    anxiety.
  </li>
  <li> Uncondition it with virtual reality training</li>
  <li> Reward people for not being scared of it</li>
  <li> Social Cognitive Perspective: observation - scared of
    something because others are
  </li>
  <li> Use models that are not afraid of the thing to overcome
    the fear
  </li>
  <li> Biological perspective: OCD is treatable with drugs, so it
    is biological
  </li>
  <li> Inborn biological fear</li>
</ul>
<h2>08c - Mood Disorders</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Depression</li>
  <li> Major Affective Disorder (Unipolar Depression)</li>
  <li> Sad for at least 6 months</li>
  <li> Can affect a prson's life very much</li>
  <li> Common disorder</li>
  <li> Symptoms: poor appetite, insomnia, feelings of
    worthlessness, loss of interest of others, sleeping 14~15
    hours a day, weight gain due to lack of activity, clear
    thoughts of suicide
  </li>
  <li> Suicide is an easy diagnosis of depression</li>
  <li> Bipolar depression</li>
  <li> Extreme highs and lows (sometimes extremely happy,
    grandiose, euphoric; sometimes extremely unhappy)
  </li>
  <li> In fact, I become God and I still am God.</li>
  <li> Easily agitated, possibly violent</li>
  <li> Tends to waste lots of money on gambling</li>
  <li> Tends to become poets</li>
  <li> Pressured speech: words are spoken so quickly that they
    are not properly formed, indicating high energy
  </li>
  <li> Sometimes does not sleep for weeks</li>
  <li> Cycles between high and lows in matter of hours (rapid
    cycling), months, or years.
  </li>
  <li> Women suffer from depression a lot more than men
    (commonly, twice).
  </li>
  <li> Men are a lot more likely to suicide from depression.</li>
  <li> Psychoanalytic perspective: depression is anger turned
    inward
  </li>
  <li> Therepy is to get anger expressed at something else</li>
  <li> Biological perspective: there is genetic component in mood
    disorders
  </li>
  <li> Depletion of noradrenalin and seratonin leads to
    depresion, so we can take these pills to elevate their
    levels.
  </li>
  <li> It is not their levels that causes disorder, but how the
    level is regulated
  </li>
  <li> Social Cognitive perspective: it's my fault (or blaming)
  </li>
  <li> Internal: It's my fault</li>
  <li> Stable: I can't change it</li>
  <li> Global: It will affect me my whole life</li>
  <li> e.g. She broke up with me because I am scum, and I will
    always be scum
  </li>
  <li> Vicious cycle of negative thoughts and moods and thoughts
    and moods
  </li>
  <li> Break the vicious cycle: positive spin</li>
</ul>
<h2>08d - Psychotic Disorders - Schizophrenia</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The problem with schizophrenia is that we can't understand
    them, so we can't treat them well
  </li>
  <li> Characteristics</li>
  <li> Disorganised thinking</li>
  <li> Delusions (false beliefs): thinking that people on TV are
    sending them secret messages
  </li>
  <li> Disturbed perceptions, e.g. auditory hallucinations: "can
    you hear that?"
  </li>
  <li> Inappropriate emotions, e.g. laughing while telling a sad
    story
  </li>
  <li> Withdrawal from other people</li>
  <li> Flat Affect (not effect): no emotion o anything</li>
  <li> Types</li>
  <li> Paranoid: delusions and hallucinations</li>
  <li> example: the guy with a stuffed pig in RED</li>
  <li> Disorganised: flat emotions, inappropriate emotions</li>
  <li> Catatonic: immobility, extreme negativism</li>
  <li> Residual: social withdrawal</li>
  <li> Undifferentiated (catch-all): everything else</li>
  <li> Positive and negative symptoms</li>
  <li> Positive: the delusions and hallucinations (what drugs can
    knock off)
  </li>
  <li> Negative symptoms: the social withdrawal and inappropriate
    emotions
  </li>
  <li> Explanations</li>
  <li> Psychoanalytic perspective: irrational</li>
  <li> overflowing of irrational unconscious</li>
  <li> Biological perspective (the right one): dopamine
    involved
  </li>
  <li> twins tend to have it together</li>
  <li> Social Cognitive perspective</li>
  <li> Stress diathesis model: either short, high stress or
    long-time, regular stress can cause schizophrenia
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>08e - Dissociative Disorders - Multiple Personalities</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Difference between schizophrenia and dissociative
    disorders
  </li>
  <li> Dissociative disorder patients don't have disorganised
    thinking. They appear normal.
  </li>
  <li> Dissociative disorder patients divide consciousness and
    lose sense of who they are
  </li>
  <li> Fugue state</li>
  <li> person disappears and becomes someone totally different
    (woke up one day, didn't know who they were, began new life)
    --&gt; critics claim individual just wanted a new life
  </li>
  <li> never two people at the same time</li>
  <li> Dissociative identity disorder</li>
  <li> One body can share many different identities ('persons')
  </li>
  <li> It is a way to cope with anxiety</li>
  <li> Is it real: a controvercy</li>
  <li> For: different brain activity for different
    personalities
  </li>
  <li> Against: almost everybody diagnosed were hypnotised</li>
</ul>
<h2>08f - Personality Disorders</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Anti-social ('sociopath'), difficulty getting along with
    people
  </li>
  <li> Appears as if the person does not have a conscious</li>
  <li> Brutal acts, calming, charismatic (??)</li>
  <li> Not happy nor upset about hurting other people</li>
  <li> They HAVE coherent thinking (so, not schizophrenic)</li>
  <li> No evidence of what causes this</li>
  <li> Histrionic (95% women), Narcissistic (80% men), and
    Borderline (mostly women) personalities
  </li>
  <li> Impulsive, dramatic, defensive style of relating to
    others
  </li>
  <li> Can't get along with other people (others dislike them)
  </li>
  <li> Avoidant personality disorder</li>
  <li> high anxiety causing social withdrawal =&gt; social
    phobia
  </li>
  <li> Schizoid personality disorder</li>
  <li> magical thoughts, eccentric behaviour, milder version of
    schizophrenia
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>09a - anxiety - cognitive behvioural therapy (50%)</h2>
<ul>
  <li> works well for phobias</li>
  <li> mood disorders - medication and therapy</li>
  <li> schizophrenia - medication</li>
</ul>
<h2>09b - anxiety disorders</h2>
<ul>
  <li> phobias - very good at treating</li>
  <li> systematic desensitisation - keep heart rate low, expose
    to spiders
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>09c - mood disorders</h2>
<ul>
  <li> major depression - medication / cognitive behavioural
    therapy
  </li>
  <li> no systematic desensitisation (doesn't work for
    depression)
  </li>
  <li> they tend to catastrophise events --&gt; it's me, it's
    always me, and it'll ruin my life
  </li>
  <li> so just convince them that nothing has to stay how they
    are and they won't ruin their lifes :)
  </li>
  <li> cognitive behaviour therapy: people who are in the waiting
    lists also drop slightly in "depression score" (from 23 to
    21)
  </li>
  <li> 30-40% get better without any treatment in 6-9 months</li>
  <li> electro-comvulsive therapy (ECT): electrical impulses,
    used to be punishment, side effects include getting better
  </li>
  <li> now uses anesthesia</li>
  <li> controvertial (unsure how it works)</li>
  <li> major bipolar disorders</li>
  <li> just medication (lithium)</li>
  <li> schizophrenia</li>
  <li> just medication</li>
  <li> often includes group therapy (lets people withstand the
    fact that they have an illness)
  </li>
  <li> group of grad students went and said "i am hearing
    voices..." and 11 were diagnosed as schizophrenics and
    admitted into a mental hospital
  </li>
  <li> even more intriguingly, real schizophrenics can tell those
    grad students weren't schizophrenic
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>09d - evaluating psychotherapies</h2>
<ul>
  <li> hypnosis creates false memories</li>
  <li> we need to see if psychotherapies are effective, and
    whether they are good for people
  </li>
  <li> problems</li>
  <li> we can't ask patient if they got better (they want to get
    better -&gt; they say they're getting better)
  </li>
  <li> we can't ask psychiatrist if patient got better (they need
    to show progress and get paid)
  </li>
  <li> pretest + posttest, measure something</li>
  <li> problem: people show up to therapy when they are at their
    worst (spontaneous remission), so they must get better with
    or without therapy
  </li>
  <li> problem: guessing again will likely get you a higher
    score; same concept for therapy scores
  </li>
  <li> fix: provide with standard, known effective treatment with
    new, maybe-more-effective treatment
  </li>
  <li> pick an indicator as a measurement</li>
  <li> dr.johnathan oakman on social phobias</li>
  <li> control: guided self help (buy a book, read it with a
    therapist)
  </li>
  <li> group 2: standard cognitive behaviour therapy (group
    activities)
  </li>
  <li> group 3: same as group 3, but videotaped, later shown back
    to social phobics to show them that they didn't look awkward
  </li>
  <li> turns out they all work about the same</li>
  <li> COST EFFECTIVENESS of psychotherapy means that the first
    guided self help method will be more commonly used
  </li>
  <li> is psychotherapy effective?</li>
  <li> yes (bell curve shifts upwards), but not by a great amount
    (untreated and treated overlap by a significant amount)
  </li>
  <li> like oakman's findings, one therapy seems not to be better
    than another
  </li>
  <li> for certain types of disorders, some is better (i.e.
    systematic desensitisation works on phobias)
  </li>
  <li> training matters?</li>
  <li> turns out, no</li>
  <li> what's effective?</li>
  <li> personal relationship that builds between therapist and
    client
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>10a - Social Psychology I: The Power of the Situation</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Prof studies social psychology.</li>
  <li> Root of social psychology: Kurt Lewin (leWEEN), a German
  </li>
  <li> Behaviour is a function of the person and the situation
  </li>
  <li> There is nothing quite so practical as a good theory</li>
  <li> Conformity and Obedience</li>
  <li> Bystander Intervention</li>
  <li>There is no "obvious" in social psychology.</li>
</ul>
<h2>10b - Kurt Lewin and His Two Classic Statements</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Almost all psychologists' roots trace back to Kurt Lewin -
    the father of social psychology
  </li>
  <li> Behaviour is a function of the person and the situation
  </li>
  <li> Anytime one is looking at behaviour, e power of the
    situation must be examined as well
  </li>
  <li> PROBLEM: most people believe that they're not controlled
    by the situation - they do what they want to do
  </li>
  <li> Social psychologists think that most people are the same,
    in that they are affected by the same situation at the same
    time
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>10c - Conformity and Obedience</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Conformity:</li>
  <li> The Sherif Norm Formation Study tries to explain why
    people believe what they believe and how people share those
    beliefs among the society ("norms")
  </li>
  <li> Experiment: autokinetic effect experiment (pitch black
    room, a stationary lit object seems to move)
  </li>
  <li>"How much did the light move?" --&gt; answers converge if
    done in group, consistent if done alone
  </li>
  <li>"Influence of other people is clearly affecting the
    estimate", mainly because you don't want to look like a
    moron.
  </li>
  <li> A confederate (fake test subject that's actually a
    researcher) gives a really OFF number, and he/she can really
    affect the consensus.
  </li>
  <li> Solomon Asch Conformity Study (Asch also fled Germany)
  </li>
  <li> Judgement of line lengths vs a given standard, as a
    perfectly unambiguous test
  </li>
  <li> 70% pitched in and say "long was short" (bowing to the
    group pressure)
  </li>
  <li> Obedience:</li>
  <li> The Stanley Milgram Obedience Study</li>
  <li> Two people come in, one of which is a subject, other one
    is a confederate
  </li>
  <li> Will people commit acts of cruelty (electric shocks) just
    because they are told to?
  </li>
  <li> 63% of all test subject actually gave out 450V shocks,
    despite the confederate acting dead from 350V onwards.
  </li>
  <li> We are far more susceptible to social pressure than we
    would know.
  </li>
  <li> Explaining the huge obedience</li>
  <li> Person felt that they agreed to do he experiment</li>
  <li> Only 15V each step</li>
  <li> Experimenter does not make it easy to refuse</li>
  <li> One of the most controversial studie ever!</li>
  <li> Strangely, only one person regrets being in the experiment
    (does not regret killing?)
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>10d - Bystander Intervention</h2>
<ul>
  <li> (will people help?)</li>
  <li> Kitty Genovese (1968) was killed outside her apartment, 23
    people heard her scream, but nobody helped
  </li>
  <li> Latane and Darley: I think it is a powerful situation</li>
  <li> The more people there are around, the less likely anyone
    is to help. If alone, "if you don't help, who will?"
  </li>
  <li> Smoke-filled room study</li>
  <li> People, either in 1 or 3s, fill in questionnaire in a
    room
  </li>
  <li> 55% of single participants report smoke</li>
  <li> 12% of group participants report smoke</li>
  <li> Seizure Study</li>
  <li> Same as previous experiment, but instead of smoke, some
    dude screaming "I'm gonna die" next door
  </li>
  <li> Results are the same: fewer people help if others seem
    available, with "nobody will help" (0%) at 23 people
  </li>
  <li> Get stranded on a lonely road = much more likely to get
    help than on a highway
  </li>
  <li> Latane and Darley Model of Helping</li>
  <li> Notice incident?</li>
  <li> Yes Is it an emergency?</li>
  <li> Yes Am I the one responsible?</li>
  <li> Yes Attempts to help</li>
  <li> ^--- everyone tries to be cool</li>
  <li> If people know about this theory, it is much less likely
    to occur!
  </li>
  <li> === 11a - Social Psychology II ===</li>
  <li> Perceiver shapes reality</li>
  <li> Fundamental attribution error</li>
  <li>"Why did someone do what they did?" -&gt; tries to find a
    reason for it, often incorrectly
  </li>
  <li> Stereotyping</li>
  <li> Perceiver shapes reality: distortion of reality</li>
  <li> Some stereotypes are more acceptable, e.g. ethnic group vs
    lawyers (this also being a stereotype)
  </li>
  <li> Darley and Gross: Hannah takes a test</li>
  <li> If Hannah is graded:</li>
  <li> If Hannah comes in from a mansion, she was perceived as "a
    grade higher"
  </li>
  <li> If Hannah comes in from a trailer, she was perceived as "a
    grade lower"
  </li>
  <li> If Hannah is NOT graded:</li>
  <li> Hannah is not subject to stereotyping (poor Hannah did as
    well as rich Hannah)
  </li>
  <li> This shows that if Hannah is perceived as rich, this
    affects the grader's grading
  </li>
  <li> Devine: stereotyping can affect how we evaluate people
    without us knowing
  </li>
  <li> Mean guy called Donald is being rated for violence</li>
  <li>"black" Donald is more violent than other Donalds</li>
  <li> When cued about the person's race (bicycle, pizza, KFC...)
    without specifying race, a stereotype can still be triggered
  </li>
  <li> Sinclaire and Kunda (Waterloo)</li>
  <li> Faking a job ranking, manager is black or white</li>
  <li> If ranked high, both black and white manager get good
    feedback
  </li>
  <li> If ranked low, black manager gets twice as much poor
    feedback as the white one
  </li>
  <li> Self-fulfilling prophecies</li>
  <li> Rosenthal and Jacobson</li>
  <li> Went into a primary school classroom and told the teacher
    that random 5 kids in the class will be geniuses
  </li>
  <li> These 5 kids actually learnt more after a year</li>
  <li> Snyder, Tanke, Bersheid</li>
  <li> Ask men to talk to women over the phone</li>
  <li> Men got a picture of the women; women did not get the
    same
  </li>
  <li> Men talk on the phone with women</li>
  <li> ^ Men talk nicely to "attractive" women (shown on photo)
  </li>
  <li> | Women get nice treatment, replies nicely</li>
  <li> -- Attractive women perceived as nicer</li>
  <li> Two-factor theory of Emotion</li>
  <li> William James: we run away from a bear (physiological),
    then we find ourselves running, knowing it must be scare
  </li>
  <li> Others: It must the opposite man</li>
  <li> Two factor theory: BOTH.</li>
  <li> Physiological arousal can become ANY kind of emotion,
    depending on the label given to it
  </li>
  <li> Anger and your mother study</li>
  <li> How many sex partners do your mother have: 4-6, 6-10,
    10-20...?
  </li>
  <li> Confederate, who did the questionnaire along with the
    subject, showed anger
  </li>
  <li> Given Told Showed</li>
  <li> Adrenaline Might arouse you Nothing</li>
  <li> Adrenaline "It is adrenaline" Nothing</li>
  <li> Adrenaline Nothing will happen Anger</li>
  <li> shows anger because confederate is the only source of
    explaining what they're feeling
  </li>
  <li> Placebo Might arouse you Nothing</li>
  <li> Attraction and the bridge</li>
  <li> Woman meets a guy across the suspension bridge, high or
    low, giving out her phone number
  </li>
  <li> Bridge Arousal Men call back? (%)</li>
  <li> high high 50 (arousal misinterpreted as love)</li>
  <li> low low 10</li>
  <li> Cognitive dissonance</li>
  <li> By Leon Festinger (Lewin's most famous student)</li>
  <li> What happens when we have thoughts that don't fit?</li>
  <li> Alien beams messages to woman who claims the world will
    end
  </li>
  <li> On the day after the world was supposed to end, alien
    beams message said that their devotion saved the world
  </li>
  <li> Festinger and Carlsmith</li>
  <li> Do boring things for an hour</li>
  <li> Told to lie to the next subject and say that "this
    experiment is fun!"
  </li>
  <li> Paid ($) Experiment rating</li>
  <li> 0 -1</li>
  <li> 1 5 &lt;-- higher satisfaction than because subjects have
    no explanations why they lied
  </li>
  <li> 20 1 &lt;-- lower satisfaction than because subjects think
    they did it for money
  </li>
  <li> Zanna &amp; Cooper</li>
  <li> Conflict in thoughts (dissonance) will make you feel
    aroused/nervous/upset
  </li>
  <li> Asks students to write an essay to go for tuition
    increase
  </li>
  <li> Low choice condition: few people change their attitudes
  </li>
  <li> High choice condition: given "a choice" to go for either
    FOR or AGAINST tuition increase, many people change favour
    for tuition increase
  </li>
  <li> Given a relaxing pill placebo, people blame the effects on
    the pill.
  </li>
  <li> Stereotype threat</li>
  <li> Women's performance on math tests</li>
  <li> If told both men and women "there is no gender
    difference", they did test equally well
  </li>
  <li> If told both men and women "there IS gender difference",
    men did better, women did worse
  </li>
  <li> (despite the fact that nobody said if men or women are
    better for the test)
  </li>
  <li> Davies, Spencer, Quinn, Gerhardstein</li>
  <li> If women are shown "girly" TV ads prior to a test, they do
    worse at math
  </li>
  <li> If women are shown "neutral" ads prior to a test, they do
    better at math
  </li>
  <li> TV commercials DON'T affect men.</li>
  <li> This also works for "picking quantitative/verbal majors in
    college"
  </li>
  <li> Again, men are not affected, but women switch to wanting
    more verbal majors.=== 12b - The Psychology of Sex ===
  </li>
  <li> The Kinsey report</li>
  <li> Kinsey wanted to know more about sex, and what other
    people think about it
  </li>
  <li> (only got results from those who were willing to answer,
    of course)
  </li>
  <li> Kinsey asked questions like everyone did weird things,
    affecting the results
  </li>
  <li> Today's best practices</li>
  <li> Random sampling</li>
  <li> Completely anonymous</li>
  <li> Changed result: only 25% had an affair (modern results),
    vs 50-80% (Kinsey)
  </li>
  <li> Masters and Johnson's Study of the Sexual Response Cycle
  </li>
  <li> What physiologically responses experiendced when having
    sex?
  </li>
  <li> Brought subjects to have sex, with wires, saved readings
  </li>
  <li> Excitement phase - bodies change, blood pressure rises,
    changes in sexual organs
  </li>
  <li> Plateau phase - building up excitement</li>
  <li> Orgasm -</li>
  <li> Revolution phase - coming down, less excited, becoming
    normal
  </li>
  <li> Culture and sex</li>
  <li> If a man looks at pictures of beautiful women, their
    partners become less satisfactory
  </li>
  <li> Changes in sexual practices through cultures</li>
  <li> % births to unwed mothers</li>
  <li> western society: keeps increasing</li>
  <li> puberty for girls being hit 2 years earlier (now 12)</li>
  <li> people used to get married at the same time they hit
    puberty
  </li>
  <li> now they get married much later</li>
  <li> number of births born are decreasing dramatically, so
    %unwed is "going up"
  </li>
  <li> japan: stays 1%</li>
</ul>
<h2>12c - Achievement motivation</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Achievement motivation: want to succeed</li>
  <li> Extrinsic motivation: want to succeed because of rewards
  </li>
  <li> Intrinsic motivation: want to succeed because I want to
  </li>
  <li> Daycare magic markers study</li>
  <li> Group What did Time spent on markers next week</li>
  <li> Control "you can draw if you want 15 mins</li>
  <li> Group A "you get a sticker if you draw nice 8 mins
    (expected reward, confused if doing things for intrinsic or
    extrinsic motivation)
  </li>
  <li> Group B gets sticker if drew nice, AFTER 18 mins
    (unexpected reward)
  </li>
  <li> Leadership style</li>
  <li> Fiedler's research wants to see which leaders are great
    leaders
  </li>
  <li> Social leader, or Punishment leader, is better leadership
    style?
  </li>
  <li> Social leader is generally good, except in two conditions:
    team really sucks, or team is really good
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>12d - Psychology of health</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Placebo effect</li>
  <li> works for high blood pressure, heart attacks, angina</li>
  <li> not as well as advertised because people often seek
    medication at their worst (regression to the mean)
  </li>
  <li> very effective in dealing with pain</li>
  <li> Stress</li>
  <li> Type I stress: too many things to do</li>
  <li> If you feel in control, it is not nearly as stressful</li>
  <li> Rat that can control stressor bys shutting it down, did
    not get cancer
  </li>
  <li>"I'm not sure" --&gt; panic</li>
  <li>"I'm sure, I accept challenge" --&gt; focus</li>
  <li> Type II stress: feels bad not feeling bad enough</li>
  <li> Phases</li>
  <li> Phase I: stressor triggers alarm (resources mobilised)
  </li>
  <li> Phase II: coping with stressor</li>
  <li> Phase III: reserves depleted</li>
  <li> Immune systems start to break down: lymphocytes don't work
    as well, cholesterol increases, prone to cancer
  </li>
  <li> Health promotion</li>
  <li> Exercise</li>
  <li> Relax</li>
